When writing resumes, we need to strive to align the content with the job description of the hiring company. However, different companies often have varying requirements and focal points for the same position, which can make resume revisions chaotic. The WeWantYou website can help you store job description information for different companies, analyze the match between your uploaded resume and the target position, and visualize the data. It also provides corresponding modification suggestions. Additionally, it stores information on your past resume versions and compares their fit to the target positions, helping you choose a specific version of your resume based on the situation.
